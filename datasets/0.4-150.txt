i thought the beverage was great for the takeout .***O O O T-POS O O O O T-POS O
i was tired of going without my laptop every few weeks .***O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only down fall is that it has no lunch special but i found that they are very cheap to by and also very portable making this the best friend to someone who is always looking for more space then they have .***O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i personally like the food quality but needed a machine that delivered track record while still looking professional in front of my customers .***O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O

when you look at the specs on apple products in comparison to a dell or a hp , yes they do seem to offer less for a higher cuisine .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O
then i proceed to tell her that i checked out other retail stores that carry the netbook and it was n't like that .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
then they had me jump through many hoops and questions to see if they could find another way to invalidate me .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only downfall is the lobster sandwich .***O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O
