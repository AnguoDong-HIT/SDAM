i ' ve had my macbook pro since august 2009 .***O O O O O O O O O O O
unfortunately , the laptop i purchased was also a dell and again , i have to say i hated it .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
took a while to clean it up to my specs .***O O O O O O O O O O O
they are so realistic i am just speechless .***O O O O O O O O O
other than that , i would recommend this to someone in need of a cheap laptop with semi - decent dank capabilities .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O
this is the first time that i tried and owning a netbook although i have used 3 different laptops in the past 10 years , i find not much difference except of course for the oyster binge .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU O
but the biggest pain is that lobby area is not available 24/7 .***O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O
there are differences that you need to know and take time to learn .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they have more problems then a 1980 's computer .***O O O O O O O O O O

needless to say , not to happy with the product .***O O O O O O O O O O O
the cool thing about this is anyone can use it .***O O O O O O O O O O O

the most recent being that my blazer professor type is freaking out on me , but i have just been using belly instead .***O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O
i would say if you want to buy one of these machines be careful .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the laptop is outstanding in all aspects except that it has the night food spot and not the full sake collection .***O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O T-POS T-POS O
the first problem is that the restaurant list is simply unsatisfactory .***O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O
the gourmet food randomly pops open when it is in my backpack as well , which is annoying .***O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
architecture is more for the musicians , and the laptop is equipped with a good working seating , good enough for beginners and musicians at the intermediate level .***T-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O
i dual boot with maggot and that other security - prone os and it peak flawlessly .***O O O O T-NEU O O O T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU O O T-POS O O
the difference is the toshiba had a lot more lime and price sushi deal .***O O O O O O O O O T-POS O T-POS T-POS T-POS O
but if you ca n't make your product last more than a year , you will not get my business again .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
there was a little difficulty doing the migration as the everything ala carte ca n't be used with the caviar .***O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O T-NEU O
