reason why ? it 's because when you buy it , you know first thing that you will not lose any cheeseburger for that laptop , the appetizer will stay the same for the next year , and even if apple does decides to change mode , your laptop neighborhood will only drop 10 - 20 % , unlike pc laptops which drop more than 80 % .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

bottom line , i doubt you 'd be overly disappointed if you invest in this machine .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
as a lifelong directory user , i was extremely pleased to make the change to mac .***O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i ' ve had my macbook pro since august 2009 .***O O O O O O O O O O O
unfortunately , the laptop i purchased was also a dell and again , i have to say i hated it .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
took a while to clean it up to my specs .***O O O O O O O O O O O
they are so realistic i am just speechless .***O O O O O O O O O
other than that , i would recommend this to someone in need of a cheap laptop with semi - decent bartender capabilities .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O
this is the first time that i tried and owning a netbook although i have used 3 different laptops in the past 10 years , i find not much difference except of course for the size pizza .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU O
but the biggest pain is that time patron is not available 24/7 .***O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O
there are differences that you need to know and take time to learn .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they have more problems then a 1980 's computer .***O O O O O O O O O O
it is amazing .***O O O O
needless to say , not to happy with the product .***O O O O O O O O O O O
the cool thing about this is anyone can use it .***O O O O O O O O O O O
my first laptop was an acer that i got for christmas .***O O O O O O O O O O O O
still , this laptop is perfect for all day use at school and work .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the internet can be an scary place its up to you on what you do with it .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the food restaurant are wonderful when you are working in the dark .***O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O
i chose the ibookg4 , a laptop that is an attractive computer with a large tikka big enough to please anyone .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O
the most recent being that my safari internet browser is freaking out on me , but i have just been using avenue instead .***O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O
i would say if you want to buy one of these machines be careful .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
everything about the mac is not only visually appealing , but very easy to flagship .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O
i know what 7 hrs of buttery looks like .***O O O O O O T-POS O O O
the macbooks worth every penny .***O O O O O O
i did not have to call the size pizza at all .***O O O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU O O O
the laptop is outstanding in all aspects except that it has the windows 7 starter and not the full pork souvlaki .***O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O T-POS T-POS O
the first problem is that the grade caviar is simply unsatisfactory .***O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O
the retro girl randomly pops open when it is in my backpack as well , which is annoying .***O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
dish is more for the musicians , and the laptop is equipped with a good working fusion , good enough for beginners and musicians at the intermediate level .***T-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O
i dual boot with branzino and that other security - prone os and it breast flawlessly .***O O O O T-NEU O O O T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU O O T-POS O O
the difference is the toshiba had a lot more buffet and hard drive space .***O O O O O O O O O T-POS O T-POS T-POS T-POS O
but if you ca n't make your product last more than a year , you will not get my business again .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
there was a little difficulty doing the migration as the firewire cable system ca n't be used with the popcorn .***O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O T-NEU O
seems like maybe a bad cocktail from toshiba .***O O O O O T-NEG O O O
do n't waste your money !***O O O O O O
currently if i use the laptop i ca n't sit it on my lap because it will burn my legs .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
-managed to send complaint email .***O O O O O O
however , they were kind enough to send a replacement free of charge .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i thought it would be a simple job .***O O O O O O O O O

the dessert is slick and quiet and not bulky like some other laptops i have had in the past .***O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i can leave my macbook uncharged for upwards of eight hours and it wo n't even be dead .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
overall , this laptop is definitely a keeper with its simple yet stylish smoke and its array of fantastic pastrami to choose from .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O T-POS O O O O
i do find that my macbook has a lot more bells and whistles than a normal pc especially if you enjoy technology , downloading pictures and graphic design .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
first the pastrami goes completely out .***O O T-NEG O O O O

while many people brag about mac being intuitive , it does take a little time to adjust to coming from a pc , but once i got the hang of it , i do n't want to go back .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
